# DevOps Platform - Complete CI/CD with Kubernetes & Jenkins

A production-ready DevOps platform demonstrating end-to-end cloud infrastructure, containerization, and automated deployment pipelines.

## 🎯 Overview

This project showcases a complete DevOps workflow from code commit to production deployment on AWS. It combines multiple technologies to create a scalable, automated platform that can handle real-world scenarios.

**Key Achievement:** Automated CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys containerized applications to Kubernetes with automatic scaling - **31,400+ requests handled during load testing without failure** ✅

---

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Infrastructure as Code** - Complete AWS infrastructure automated with Terraform  
✅ **Containerization** - Multi-stage Docker builds for Go and Python applications  
✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** - Jenkins with GitHub webhook integration for automatic deployments  
✅ **Kubernetes Orchestration** - AWS EKS with rolling updates and zero-downtime deployments  
✅ **Auto-Scaling** - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for dynamic resource management

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
✓ AWS Account with credentials configured
✓ Terraform installed
✓ kubectl installed
✓ Docker installed (optional, for local testing)
```

### Deploy in 3 Steps

**Step 1: Clone & Configure**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aivora017/devops-platform.git
cd devops-platform
aws configure  # Set your AWS credentials
```

**Step 2: Deploy Infrastructure**
```bash
cd terraform/aws
terraform init
terraform plan   # Review changes
terraform apply  # Deploy (takes ~15-20 min)
```

**Step 3: Verify & Access**
```bash
# Check cluster
kubectl get nodes

# View applications
kubectl get pods -n devops

# Get LoadBalancer endpoint
kubectl get svc go-api-service -n devops
```

## 🔄 How CI/CD Works

The pipeline automatically triggers when you push code to GitHub:

```
1. Developer pushes code → GitHub
                ↓
2. GitHub webhook → Jenkins
                ↓
3. Jenkins Build Stage
   • Checkbox: Git checkout
   • Build Go & Python Docker images
   • Push to Docker Hub (aivora017/* with version tags)
                ↓
4. Jenkins Deploy Stage
   • kubectl updates Kubernetes deployments
   • Pulls new images from Docker Hub
   • Rolling update strategy (zero downtime)
                ↓
5. Kubernetes takes over
   • New pods spin up with updated code
   • Old pods gracefully terminated
   • HPA monitors and scales as needed
                ↓
6. Result
   • Production updated automatically
   • No manual intervention needed
   • Users experience zero downtime
```

### Example Commit Flow
```bash
$ git commit -am "Add new API endpoint"
$ git push origin main

Jenkins Build #15 starts automatically ⚡
├─ Clones repo ✓
├─ Builds Docker images ✓
├─ Pushes to Docker Hub ✓
└─ Deploys to EKS ✓

Users can access new endpoint immediately!
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- **IAM Roles**: Jenkins uses EC2 instance role (no credentials stored on disk)
- **kubeconfig**: Secure Kubernetes access via AWS exec plugin
- **VPC Isolation**: Applications in private subnets
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive ingress/egress rules
- **Secret Management**: Docker Hub credentials stored securely in Jenkins
